A shooting at a bowling alley late Friday left three men dead and four people wounded in Southern California, and police are trying to find whoever fired the shots, authorities said.

The gunshots at the Gable House Bowl in Torrance went off just before midnight. A fight -- first involving young ladies, then men -- happened shortly beforehand, sending people running, a witness said.
