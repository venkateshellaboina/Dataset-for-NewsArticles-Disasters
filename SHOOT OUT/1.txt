Police killed a suspected Brinks cash truck robber in Bangkok's Nong Khaem district early Monday after he fired at police in attempt to escape arrest for the theft of 7.2 million baht late last month.

Just before the shootout, detectives learned that the suspect, Takdanai Niawrangjai, 27, was trying to hide and escape the police cordon in areas near Phutthamonthon Sai 3 and Phutthamonthon Sai 4 roads in eastern Bangkok.
