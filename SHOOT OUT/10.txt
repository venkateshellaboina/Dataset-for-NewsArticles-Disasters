A gunman opened fire at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, killing at least 12 people during a college night celebration, including a deputy sheriff who was planning to retire next year. The gunman, identified as 28-year-old Ian Long, is also dead, authorities said.

Police were called to the Borderline Bar & Grill in the Ventura County suburb, 40 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, late Wednesday Pacific time.
