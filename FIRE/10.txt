Deadly wildfires burning across Northern and Southern California have killed a total of 31 people across the state and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands.

The grim discovery of the remains of six people in the Northern California town of Paradise brought the total number of deaths related to the Camp Fire to 29, matching the deadliest fire in state history, authorities said Sunday.

Five bodies in Paradise were found in homes and one was found in a vehicle, Butte County Sheriff Kory L. Honea told reporters.
