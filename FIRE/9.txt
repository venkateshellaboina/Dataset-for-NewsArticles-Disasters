A 16-year-old girl was killed and four other people injured in a fire Wednesday night at an apartment complex in Queens. 

The fire began just after 8:30 p.m. in a second-floor apartment in the complex on Merrick Boulevard near Ursina Road in St. Albans. 

The girl's mother came home to find the apartment full of smoke.
