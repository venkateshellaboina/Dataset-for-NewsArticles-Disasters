At least 12 people are dead after a massive landslide buried dozens of homes in the central Philippines Thursday.

The latest natural disaster to strike the archipelago happened just after sunrise in Naga city on the island of Cebu. Several days of heavy monsoon rains loosened the soil on a steep mountain, sending tons of mud and rocks on top of a cluster of houses.

Authorities say as many as 50 people are missing and feared trapped in the rubble.
