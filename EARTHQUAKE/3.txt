A MAGNITUDE 6.1 earthquake has rocked New Zealand with the impact felt widely across the North Island.

According to Geoscience Australia, a government department, the quake struck about 3.20pm local time with the epicentre about halfway between Wellington and Auckland. GeoNet described the 207km-deep tremor as "strong" and said it was centred 25km southwest of Taumarunui. There were no initial reports of major damage.

The earthquake reportedly lasted for about 30 seconds and caused shaking. An Australian woman visiting the country told news.com.au she felt two shocks about two minutes apart in Wellington.
