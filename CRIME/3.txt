The Colorado man convicted of killing his pregnant wife and two young daughters spoke to investigators and provided more information about the murders, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation said Thursday.

Investigators visited convicted killer Chris Watts at the Dodge Correctional Institution in Waupun, Wisconsin, on Feb. 18, during which "Watts provided investigators with additional information about the murders of Shanann, Bella, and Celeste," the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said in a Thursday statement.

At the meeting with Watts were Frederick Police Department Detective Dave Baumhover, FBI Special Agent Grahm Coder and CBI Agent Tammy Lee, according to an inmate visitation log.
