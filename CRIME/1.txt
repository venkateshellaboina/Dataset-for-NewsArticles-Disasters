An 11-year-old girl, strangled to death in Southern California in 1973, her killer gone without a trace making a crime.

A 27-year-old woman whose body was left in a shallow grave in South Lake Tahoe, California, in 1977.

And yet another young victim, a 20-year-old woman who was sexually assaulted and killed with an electric cord in her Portland apartment in 1979.
