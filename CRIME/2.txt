A Napier woman convicted of murdering her long-term partner is back in prison for hiding her new relationship from her probation officer.

Jacqueline Elaine Wihongi was found guilty of stabbing her partner of 17 years to death with a steak knife in 2010. She is serving a sentence of 12 years' imprisonment.

She is one of only three murderers in New Zealand not given a life sentence.
