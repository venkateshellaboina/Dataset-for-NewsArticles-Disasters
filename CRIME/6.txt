A Sydney man has been found guilty of the brutal murder of his new girlfriend's toddler after a jury rejected his claim that she was the culprit.

Mohammed Khazma had denied murdering the two-year-old girl in December 2016, along with two counts of assault causing actual bodily harm.

Detectives alleged he burned the toddler with a cigarette lighter and slammed her head into a wall.
