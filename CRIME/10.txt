An activist of a prominent right-wing group is "Accused No. 1" in the frightening murder of a police officer by a mob that chased his car and shot him yesterday in violence that broke out after the cow carcasses were found scattered in a forest in Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr. Yogesh Raj, a member of the fringe group Bajrang Dal and the main accused, is missing while four have been arrested.
Yogesh Raj was the complainant in a separate case of cow slaughter after 25 carcasses were found by local people. He is seen in a video in which a police officer tries to placate him.
