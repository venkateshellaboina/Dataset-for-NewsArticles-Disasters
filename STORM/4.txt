At least 13 people have been killed and over 70,000 remain without power Monday afternoon as mid-Atlantic states dig out from Winter Storm Gia's weekend wrath.

An 81-year-old man was killed and three others were seriously injured in a crash thought to be caused by slick conditions on a highway in Jefferson County, Kansas, according to Kansas Highway Patrol. Lee Crum of Oskaloosa was killed when a pickup truck lost control and veered into his car, sending it into a roadside ditch.

The three other people involved in the crash were taken to Topeka hospitals with serious injuries.
