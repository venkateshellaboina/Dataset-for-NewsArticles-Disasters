Southeastern states were cleaning up Monday from the weekend winter storm that dropped freezing rain and more than 2 feet of snow across the region and was blamed for killing at least three people in North Carolina.

The storm began winding down on Sunday and was expected to have cleared out of the region by early Monday evening, the National Weather Service said. By midafternoon Monday, the number of customers without power had been cut by more than half, to about 155,000, utility companies reported, and canceled flight departures were below 300 after having topped 2,000 on Sunday.
