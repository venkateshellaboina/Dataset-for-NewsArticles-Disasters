At least four people died from the effects of Winter Storm Bruce, which pushed from the Plains into the Midwest and eventually New England.

Two victims were in Michigan and Maine, and both died in fatal crashes on roads made dangerous by the winter storm. In north-central Kansas, authorities found the body of a woman who went missing in the snowstorm Sunday morning.
