The Department of Defense on Friday identified three Americans killed after a suicide bomber triggered a fiery explosion Wednesday at a market in northern Syria, less than a month after President Donald Trump declared victory over Islamic State militants in the region. 

Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Jonathan R. Farmer, 37, of Boynton Beach, Florida; Navy Chief Cryptologic Technician Shannon M. Kent, 35, of upstate New York; and civilian Scott A. Wirtz of St. Louis, Missouri; were killed in the bombing in Manbij, according to the DOD.
