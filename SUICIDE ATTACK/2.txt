The US military has identified three of the four Americans killed during a suicide bombing in Syria claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group.

Jonathan Farmer, a soldier, Shannon Kent, a sailor, and civilian Scott Wirtz died in Manbij on Wednesday as a result of wounds from the blast.

IS said a militant had detonated an explosive vest next to an American patrol in the Kurdish-held town.

US forces are operating around Manbij to back Kurdish and Arab forces.

The fourth victim of the explosion is an unnamed contractor, according to US Central Command.

At least 15 people were killed in the blast, and another three US soldiers were wounded.
