 Nearly a dozen villages in Punjab's Ropar district were flooded as the overflowing Satluj river breached its banks near Laudipur village, officials said Monday.

More water was released from the Bhakra Dam reservoir Sunday as its spillways were opened to maintain the water level in the reservoir, officials of the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) said. But this led to the flooding and several acres of agriculture land was also inundated in Ropar, some 45 km from here.

Officials in Ropar said villagers were being rescued from the affected areas in the Anandpur Sahib sub-division.
