More than 30 people have died and as many as 10 lakh have been displaced in the flood in Assam - the worst in more than a decade.

The Centre on Saturday reviewed the grim flood situation and assured all help to the state government to tide over the crisis.

Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth chaired a meeting of top Central officials to assess the unprecedented floods in the state. Assam Chief Secretary P C Sharma and state government officials participated in the meeting via video-conference.
