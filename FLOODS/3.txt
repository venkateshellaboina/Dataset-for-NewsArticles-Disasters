About 1.45 lakh hectares of agricultural land is under flood waters. The Assam government has opened at least 300 relief camps across the state.

One of the ill-fated villages is Naguchipathar in Barpeta district. People in the village have been moved to higher ground resorting to desperate measures such as rafts made of banana plant trunks.

For 22-year-old Rajibul Ali, bracing massive floods is nothing new. But this time he is very worried. His first child was born only few days back when flood waters were gushing into his village.
