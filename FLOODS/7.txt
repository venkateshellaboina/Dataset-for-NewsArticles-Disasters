The flood situation continued to remain grim in Bihar's Gopalganj, Siwan and Saran districts on Monday after the Gandak river overflowed its banks, affecting thousands of people.

More than five lakh people are under threat as the water spreads, destroying standing crops and forcing people to flee their homes.

"The overflowing water of the Gandak river has entered dozens of villages and is flowing at some places on National Highway 28 that disrupted road traffic," an official of the water resource department said.
