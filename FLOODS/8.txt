Ten people were killed and about 300,000 displaced in flash floods and landslides triggered by heavy rains in the northeastern states of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, officials said Sunday.

Heavy rains triggered mudslides and flooding in at least three districts of Arunachal Pradesh, washing away bridges, huts and school buildings, besides devastating agriculture crops, a government spokesperson said.

"The devastation caused by the floods and landslides has been extensive with eight people already killed in incidents of house collapse due to landslides, besides snapping road links in many areas," said Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Dorjee Khandu.
