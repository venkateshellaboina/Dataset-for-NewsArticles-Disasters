At least four people have died in Assam over the last 24 hours, as the state still grapples with a flood that has barely shown signs of retreat over the past few days.

According to sources in the state's disaster management authority, at least four people - one each in Dalgaon, Dibrugarh, Jagiroad and Barkhetri areas have lost their lives in past 24 hours.  

Over 16 lakh people have been affected and over 2.26 lakh of them are in relief camps. Around 50 people have died in Assam in over a month in the second wave of floods this year.

Flood waters have completely ravaged over 2,000 villages and the Brahmaputra is flowing above the danger mark in six districts.
