A VOLCANO has erupted in southwestern Japan and coated a nearby city with a layer of ash.

People in Kagoshima city wore masks and raincoats and used umbrellas to shield themselves from the ash after the Sakurajima volcano erupted Sunday afternoon.

Drivers turned on their headlights, and local media described the ash like driving through snow at night.
