A MAN has suffered serious leg injuries after he was "lava bombed" by spatter from the active Kilauea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island.

Lava has been oozing out of cracks in the volcano for two weeks and about 40 properties have been destroyed.

But one man became injured when he was sitting on his porch and a "lava bomb" struck him, Hawaiian Civil Defence Administrator Talmadge Magno confirmed.
