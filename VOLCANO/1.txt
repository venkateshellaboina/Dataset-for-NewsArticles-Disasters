KRAKATOA. It's a name you've probably heard before. It's a volcano. And when it blew in 1883, it sent shockwaves around the globe. Now, it's erupting again.

It's not the beast it once was. But it is producing some rare effects.

A new mound of ash and lava has been steadily growing in the caldera left behind by the enormous explosion which killed some 36,000 people through its thermal flash and ensuing tsunamis.
