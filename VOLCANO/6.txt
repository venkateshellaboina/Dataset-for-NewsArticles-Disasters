VOLCANIC ash over Indonesia continues to cause havoc on flights to and from popular holiday spot Bali, with more flights cancelled Sunday.

Virgin Australia cancelled all flights into and out of Denpasar yesterday as winds worsen the impact of a volcanic ash cloud from Indonesia's Mt Raung.

Jetstar also cancelled six of its flights in and out of Bali yesterday.
