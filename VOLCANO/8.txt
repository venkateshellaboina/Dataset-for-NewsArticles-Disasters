ONE of Europe's most active volcanos, Mount Etna, has erupted sending up a towering plume of ash visible in much of eastern Sicily.

Etna's eruptions are not infrequent, although the last major one occurred in 1992.

Catania airport said the eruption on Saturday (Oct 26) forced the closure of nearby airspace before dawn, but authorities lifted the order in early morning.
