PEOPLE nixing vacations to Hawaii's Big Island has cost the tourism industry millions of dollars as the area's top attraction, Kilauea volcano, keeps spewing lava.

Cancellations from May through July have hit at least US$5 million ($6.7 million), said Ross Birch, executive director of the island's tourism board.

The booking pace for hotels and other activities, such as tours for lava viewing, zip lines and glass bottom boats have fallen by 50 per cent.
