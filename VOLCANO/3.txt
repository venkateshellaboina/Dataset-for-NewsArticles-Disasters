THE Bali holiday plans of Australians tourists have been thrown into doubt by fresh rumblings of the island's Mt Agung volcano.

Fights to Bali from Perth and back were tonight cancelled as a result of a fresh ash cloud from Mt Agung, which reached 2000 metres in the air.

Air Asia is in the process of cancelling a series of local and regional flights however the Bali international airport remains open.
